**** EXPLINATION ****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is JFrog Artifactory?
JFrog Artifactory is a tool for storing and managing software packages (called artifacts). 
Think of it as a central warehouse for all the files and libraries your team uses and creates during software development.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
When you're creating a new app, you need various tools and libraries.
Instead of downloading these every time, you can use Artifactory to store and retrieve them easily.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Use JFrog Artifactory? 
Store Your Files Safely:
It’s like a Dropbox for developers where you keep important files like:
Code libraries
Build files
Docker images
Other dependencies (like npm packages, Python libraries, etc.)
Organize Files for Easy Access:
It helps teams find and share files quickly without worrying about manually organizing them.
Speeds Up Development:
When developers need the same file repeatedly, Artifactory caches it, so you don’t have to download it from scratch every time.
Supports Many Types of Files:
Works with all popular tools and programming languages like:
Java (Maven, Gradle)
Node.js (npm)
Python (PyPI)
Docker containers, and more.
Works with CI/CD Tools:
It integrates with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI/CD to automatically store and use files during builds and deployments.
